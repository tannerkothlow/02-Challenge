# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

For the first assignment in our web developement program, we were tasked with refactoring an already existing website, while adding helpful accessability features. While on the surface the website remains unchanged, under the hood it's been massively optimized and made much more clean. 

For one, the messy html <div>'s have been replaced almost entirely with semantic tags. This has drastically improved the readability of the code and has boiled down the html code to only what is necesary. The CSS code has also been optimized, removing redundancies that stemmed from the first draft of the html code.

And second, all images on the page have been given an alt description, improving accessability for screen readers, while improving search engine optimization as a bonus. We've also achieved this by adding a succinct title and description to the html doc.

## Installation

N/A Already deployed to GitHub pages. 

## Usage

On google chrome, to view the image's alt text, right click on the page and inspect element. Click on the element inspector in the upper left corner of the dev tools. (It looks like a small box with an arrow pointing inwards.) Then simply hover over an image to view its attributes and alt text.
